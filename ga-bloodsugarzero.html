  <p><i>[This episode starts in a mall, with chocolate fudge being poured onto a pile of french fries out of a ketchup dispenser.<br>
The camera pans back to showcase Sally, doing this in a mall food court.<br>
Autumn looks on, rather disgusted.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> You're putting... chocolate on french fries?</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> I put chocolate on everything. I dunno why you're still surprised.</p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> I guess I'm just getting tired of all the Spooks & Kooks candy you've been devouring lately.</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Hey, you know what happens when I don't eat my entire weight in chocolate every single day!</p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> Yeah, all too well. I think I still have bite marks from that camping trip.</p>

  <p><i>[Robert and Max return with their food.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Robert:</b> C'mon, honey, we survived.</p>

  <p><b>Max:</b> Barely.</p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> Still, you might be overdoing the chocolate just a teensy tiny bit.</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> C'mon, Autumn, 'tis the season! What kind of kid would I be if I didn't—</p>

  <p><i>[Sally pushes again and nothing comes out of the dispenser.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> The kind of kid who's all out of chocolate.</p>

  <p><b>Max:</b> Sally... Spooks & Kooks Day was only three days ago.</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Yeah, I know! I was being as sparing as possible with it! I'm out already?!</p>

  <p><b>Robert:</b> I'm sure you've got some more at home.</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Yeah, if Gumdrops doesn't find my stash!</p>

  <p><b>Robert:</b> Well, someone around here is bound to have some kind of—</p>

  <p><i>[Reverse shot to show Sally's seat empty, with nothing more than a cloud of dust.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Robert:</b> Chocolate.</p>

  <p><i>[Sally slams her french fries down on the counter with a crash.<br>
She is disheveled, like an addict.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Do you have any chocolate?!</p>

  <p><i>[The cashier kid looks at her.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Cashier:</b> Uh... yeah, of course. Just try and chill for a bit.</p>

  <p><i>[Sally leans on the counter and grabs the cashier's collar.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> CHOCOLATE.</p>

  <p><b>Cashier:</b> Right away, ma'am.</p>

    <p><i>[The cashier kid walks over to a chocolate dispenser.<br>
He tries to pour it into a small french fry container.<br>
He presses the plunger and a small drop comes out.<br>
The cashier turns toward Sally.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Cashier:</b> Apparently we're all out of chocolate, so I'm going to say goodbye.</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Why, you—</p>

  <p><i>[Sally tries to jump at him but a security grate falls down.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Cashier: </b>Thank you for shopping at Silly Burger. I'm not really in the mood for dying today, so I have to say that our store is closed. Please come again soon.</p>

  <p><i>[Sally mopes back to the table before crashing onto it.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Max:</b> I take it they were all out of chocolate.</p>

  <p><i>[Sally pulls herself up weakly.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Yes, and I don't know how long these fries are gonna—</p>

  <p><i>[The camera pulls back to show that Sally's french fries are missing.<br>
She looks to see that her food has fallen on the floor.<br>
A janitor is sweeping it up.]</i></p>

  <p><b>Autumn:</b> Uh... Sally, are you gonna be okay?</p>

  <p><b>Sally:</b> Sure... as soon as I get my... <i>choco... chocolate...</i></p>
