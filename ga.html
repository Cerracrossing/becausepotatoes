  <p><b>--- About ---</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;<i>Growing Around</i> follows the life of Sally Dunn and her family, in a world where kids are in charge. While the world's far from perfect and chaos is inevitable, Sally does her best to embrace it and help her family to do the same!</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Growing Around has been in development for over eight years. Throughout that time, many ideas—and many collaborators—have come and gone. In their place, the project has turned into a bit of a mess—yet, working with it is still a blast, and that hasn't changed! So, to this day we're still determined to see the project to its end. We've done a lot of restructuring throughout the past year, and there's sure to be much more ahead. Once we figure out where to take the project, we'll be excited to show it off! Until then, thank you to anyone who remains interested. It means the world to us, and we can't wait to welcome you all back to Summerway when the time is right.
<br><br>Update 2023: Growing Around is on hiatus until further notice.
<br><br>Update March 2023: Due to several concerning <a href="https://archive.ph/dWGYL">derogatory</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/q2jMH">comments</a> made in recent weeks, the Mr. Enter team will no longer be associating with Kyle/Nayolfa, and will be removing his credit from Growing Around. We no longer support Kyle, and we condemn his derogatory statements and beliefs.</p>
